# Components

Recently i am studying more about components so lets discover some interesting and important things on stateless/functional components.

**Stateless/Functional**

Functional components are simpler. They don’t manage their own state or have access to the life cycle methods provided by React Native. They are literally plain JavaScript functions. They are also known as stateless components.
Functional components generally are just used for display purposes — these components call functions from parent components to handle user interactions or state updates.

ES6’s arrow function syntax that takes props : Child Component

import React from ‘react’
import { View, Text } from ‘react-native’;
const Greeting = (props) => {
return (
<View>
<Text>Hello! {props.textFirstName}</Text>
<Text>{props.textLastName}</Text>
</View>
)
}
export default Greeting;

Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.

Now Rendering Greeting Component from Parent Component

import React, { Component } from ‘react’;
import {View} from ‘react-native’;
import Greeting from ‘./src/components/hello’;
export default class App extends Component {
render() {
return (
<View>
<Greeting
textFirstName={‘Bijoy’}
textLastName={‘Mohanta’}
/>
</View>
);
}
}

=> Functional because they are basically JavaScript functions
=> Stateless because they do not hold and/or manage state
=> Presentational components generally are just used for display purposes

**Another Example**

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ alignItems: 'center' }}>
        <Text>{this.props.name}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

**Import components**

import React, { Component } from ‘react’;
import {View} from ‘react-native’;
import Greeting from ‘./Greeting’;
export default class App extends Component {
render() {
return (
<View>
<Greeting
textFirstName={‘Bijoy’}
textLastName={‘Mohanta’}
/>
</View>
);
}
}
