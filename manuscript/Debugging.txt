# Debugging

**Accessing console logs**
You can display the console logs for an iOS or Android app by using the following commands in a terminal while the app is running:

$ react-native log-ios
$ react-native log-android


There are 3 methods that I use to debug when developing React Native apps:

console.log(): shows in console
console.warn(): shows in yellow box bottom of application
alert(): shows as a prompt just like it does in web

console.log("Your strings or varible here",name);
console.warn("Your strings or varible here",name);
alert("Your strings or varible here",name);
